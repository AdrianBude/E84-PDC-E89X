# E84-PDC-E89X
 

I copied all parameters from PDC87.C05 and merged them with the few new ones in PDC84.C15. 
I also adjusted E89SGVT so that it can detect coding index 15 outside of the E84.
There won't be any conflicts even if you try to code an actual E84.

Copy to *NCSEXPERT folder*\DATEN\E89

You will need the latest DATEN files.
